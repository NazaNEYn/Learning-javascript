## Value And Variable

**Value**: a piece of data <br>
*Example:* console.log("Naz") <br>

**Variable** : It's a box that we can store a value in.

We can store values into variables. So this way we can reuse them over and over again. <br>
let firstName = "Naz" <br>
"Naz" is a value and we assigned it to a variable. It's called *declaring a variable*.
