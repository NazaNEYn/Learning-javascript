## Value And Variable

**Value**: a piece of data <br>
*Example:* console.log("Naz") <br>

**Variable** : It's a box that we can store a value in.

We can store values into variables. So this way we can reuse them over and over again. <br>
let firstName = "Naz" <br>
"Naz" is a value and we assigned it to a variable. It's called *declaring a variable*.
<br>

## Data Types

Evey value is either:
1. Object : <br>
let me  { <br>
        name: "Naz" <br>
}

2. Primitive : <br> 
let firstName = "Naz" <br>
let age = 30 

A value is only primitive when it's not an object.

### Primitive Data Types :
1. number  
2. string
3. boolean
4. undefined
5. null
6. symbol
7. big int

**Number**: <br>
let age = 30
